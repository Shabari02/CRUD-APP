## Introduction

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React and Java Spring Boot. The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a data set stored in a backend database.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete data entries
- Responsive and intuitive user interface
- Input validation and error handling
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Back-end API endpoints to handle data operations

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Java Spring Boot: A framework for building enterprise-level Java applications quickly.
- XAMPP Server: A local development environment that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl.
- Node.js and npm: Required for managing front-end dependencies and building the React application.
- Git: Version control system to track changes and manage code collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- Java Development Kit (JDK): [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
